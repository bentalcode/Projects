/**
 * The IDoublet interface defines a doublet.
 * In quantum mechanics, a doublet is a mixed quantum state of a system with a spin of 1/2,
 * such that there are two allowed values of the spin component,
 * âˆ’1/2 and +1/2.
 * Quantum systems with two possible states are sometimes called two-level systems.
