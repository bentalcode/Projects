Another bit of jargon, is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[174] The company is also known for its hiring process, mimicked in other organizations and dubbed the "Microsoft interview", which is notorious for off-the-wall questions such as "Why is a manhole cover round?".[175]
