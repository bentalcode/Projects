Microsoft released Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for MS-DOS,[15]:242–243, 246 despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM the previous August.[30] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington on February 26, 1986, and went public on March 13,[31] with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.[32] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.[15] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government.[33] :243–244 Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32 application programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[34]
